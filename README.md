# Cyclistic-Case-Study

Introduction

For the capstone project, I have selected the Cyclistic bike share analysis case study to work. For the case study, I will perform the real-world tasks of a junior data analyst for the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.

To answer key business questions, I followed the six steps of the data analysis process taught in the course which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

- Detailed documentation of SQL code is available in GitHub.
- Initial analysis of datasets provided by Cyclistic using Microsoft Excel.
- Data cleaning, manipulation and exploration using Microsoft SQL.
- Data Visualization using Tableau Public.
- Provides data-driven recommendations based on the analysed data.
